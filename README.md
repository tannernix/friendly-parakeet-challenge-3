## Description

For this third homework assignment I was to create a password generator by letting the user prompt a few objectives and meet the certain criteria I was giving them all so they could produce a random generated password. This website could now help companies or individuals looking to get a secure and secret good password for any webpage or account that they needed a password for. Overall, I learned more about the basics of javascript and how to apply functions and variables better. Thank you!
